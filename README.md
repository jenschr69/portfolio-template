This is a template / example of minimum content for a web developer portfolio website.

GitHub: jenschr69/portfolio-template

To this demo I've added a custom (sub) domain - https://cv.jenschrchristensen.com

The template is based on W3Schools resume template made with the W3 css framework:

This GitHub Project focus on creating a basic portfolio website, and is the basis for learning and practicing how to setup a basic implementation of
Google Analytics through Google Tag Manager.

The course Introduction to Web Analytics for Developers will be published on the course site Glodexa Jobb - https://jobb.glodexa.se , 
but access will be by special invite only.
When making the portfolio website for this course, it's very important to create and put some content on all the different pages.
We are going to use that when we set up Google Analytics for our portfolio website.
